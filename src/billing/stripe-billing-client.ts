/**
 * The narrow port `src/billing/` performs Stripe customer/checkout/portal/subscription
 * operations through. Production wires the real Stripe SDK (`stripe-client.ts`); the E2E harness
 * wires a fixture — see the plan's "Testing Stripe" section (no Stripe account, no network,
 * fixtures only). A caller never learns which one it got.
 *
 * This is deliberately not `@better-auth/stripe`: that plugin's checkout reaches
 * `stripe.checkout.sessions.create` with no seam narrower than the whole `Stripe` client, so the
 * money test could not run without mocking the SDK. Better Auth still owns auth, organizations,
 * sessions, and permissions; billing authorizes every reference through `OrganizationAccess`.
